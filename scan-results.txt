Public IP: <paste your public IP here>

Local phone IP: <paste the local IP from Wi-Fi settings>

Port test results (from YouGetSignal / PortChecker):
- Port 22 (SSH): <OPEN or CLOSED>
- Port 80 (HTTP): <OPEN or CLOSED>
- Port 443 (HTTPS): <OPEN or CLOSED>
- Port 3389 (RDP): <OPEN or CLOSED>

Notes:
Router admin page was not accessible, so I used online scanners. If any port is OPEN: disable port forwarding, disable UPnP, enable router firewall, and update services.
